# REVIEW.md — The Gödel Gate (Meta-Protocol Audit)

> A protocol that audits the protocol itself. Run by a **separate, independent agent**
> against a fixed checklist. The reviewer has no memory of prior work, no stake in
> the decisions made, and no incentive to agree.
>
> **The gate closes the epistemic loop:** If the same AI that wrote the code also
> writes the spec, the explainer, the tests, and the compliance report — nothing
> has been verified. Independence is the entire point.

## When to Run This

| Trigger | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Before phase exit | Every phase transition calls for a review (DISCOVER → WORK, WORK → PERFECT, PERFECT → DISTRIBUTE) |
| Before DISTRIBUTE | **Mandatory.** No project ships without a clean review. |
| After EXPLAINER | Verify the explainer matches the code, not the spec. |
| After SPEC SYNC | Double-check the sync gate's own work. |
| On any ambiguity | If you feel uncertain about quality, run a review. |

**Exception**: PROTOTYPING phase (VALIDATION.md) — prototypes are throwaway by design. Review is not needed. But the KILL/PIVOT/COMMIT decision itself should be reviewed if you're unsure.

---

## Independence Protocol (Required)

The reviewer agent MUST be launched as a **separate session** with:

1. **Different session** — Start a new AI session. Do NOT continue the building session.
2. **No prior context** — Provide ONLY the protocol docs + the project files. No conversation history, no memory of decisions made, no knowledge of what was "intended."
3. **Fixed checklist provided** — The reviewer gets the checklist below verbatim. They don't invent criteria.
4. **Output-only** — The reviewer reads and reports. They do NOT edit, fix, or improve anything.
5. **Blind to builder intent** — The reviewer compares spec vs code vs explainer. They do not accept "but the intent was..." as an argument.

### Independence Check

Before accepting review results, verify:

- [ ] Reviewer was launched in a separate session
- [ ] Reviewer had no prior conversation history with this project
- [ ] Reviewer was given only the fixed checklist, not a "here's what we were trying to do"
- [ ] Reviewer's findings include at least one issue OR explicit clean bill with supporting evidence
- [ ] Reviewer did not edit any file during the review

## Fixed Review Checklist

Each item is binary: **PASS** or **FAIL**. No partial credit. Each FAIL becomes a fix ticket.

### Phase 1: Document Completeness

| # | Check | How to Verify (without reading code) |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | SPECIFICATION.md exists and has all 14 sections filled | Read the file. Count sections. |
| 1.2 | Every section has content (not placeholder/stub) | Read each section. No "TBD", "TODO", or blank. |
| 1.3 | Non-goals are explicitly stated | Read SPECIFICATION.md section 7 (Non-Goals). Must list what the project is NOT doing. |
| 1.4 | Success metrics are falsifiable | Read section 6. Metrics must be measurable (<3s launch, >99% uptime), not vague ("fast", "reliable"). |
| 1.5 | EXPLAINER.md exists and matches project scope | Read EXPLAINER.md. Does it describe the same project as SPECIFICATION.md? |
| 1.6 | EXPLAINER.md has all 5 required sections | Macro Architecture, Data Flow Walk, Module Breakdown, Key Decisions, Quality Guarantees. |
| 1.7 | SPEC_SYNC.md was executed and findings recorded | Read SPEC_SYNC.md output. Are there discrepancy records? |

### Phase 2: Protocol Compliance

| # | Check | How to Verify (without reading code) |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 2.1 | RULES.md phase matches current project state | Read RULES.md line 9. Does the phase label match reality? |
| 2.2 | Scope warps are documented (if any) | Read RULES.md section 4. Are any warps recorded? Max 3 warps allowed. |
| 2.3 | Test philosophy is being followed | Read RULES.md section 8. Check if test files exist (Glob for *_test.*). |
| 2.4 | No prohibited patterns used | Read RULES.md section 5 (or STANDARDS.md). Check codebase for `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, empty catch blocks, unwrap(), panic(). |
| 2.5 | Project type routing matches actual project | Read RULES.md section 1. Does the selected route fit? (A "DISCOVER-FIRST" route on a well-understood domain is a mismatch.) |

### Phase 3: Spec-vs-Explainer Cross-Reference

This is the most important check. Non-coder verification depends on it.

| # | Check | How to Verify (without reading code) |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 3.1 | SPECIFICATION.md intent matches EXPLAINER.md architecture | Compare section 3 (Intent) of spec vs section 1 (Macro Architecture) of explainer. Do they describe the same system? |
| 3.2 | EXPLAINER.md modules match what actually exists | Read Module Breakdown. Then run `ls src/` or `ls cmd/` or the project's source tree. Do the modules in the explainer actually exist? |
| 3.3 | Data flow in explainer is plausible | Read Data Flow Walk. Is the flow complete? Does it have a start and end? |
| 3.4 | Key Decisions section identifies real tradeoffs | Read Key Decisions. Are these real constraints OR generic platitudes? ("We chose X because it's good" is a FAIL.) |

### Phase 4: Observable Quality (Code-Independent Signals)

| # | Check | How to Verify (without reading code) |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 4.1 | Test files exist and are non-trivial | Count test files. Non-trivial = at least 3 test cases per module, or >50% of modules tested. |
| 4.2 | Build/compilation succeeds | Run the build command. Exit code 0 is PASS. |
| 4.3 | No leaked secrets or credentials | Grep for `-----BEGIN`, `api_key`, `password`, `token`, `secret`. Any hit is FAIL. |
| 4.4 | README has install/running instructions | Can a new user get the project running from README alone? |
| 4.5 | CI config exists (if applicable) | Check for .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc. |

### Phase 5: Regression Defenses

| # | Check | How to Verify (without reading code) |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 5.1 | Tests cover reported bugs (if any) | Read recent bug reports. Read test file names/search for related test names. |
| 5.2 | Test count increased since last review | Compare with previous review's test count. Flat or decreasing is suspicious. |
| 5.3 | Edge cases are tested (empty input, zero, boundary) | Search test files for "empty", "zero", "edge", "boundary", "error". |

## Output Format

The review agent produces a **findings document** with this structure:

```markdown
# Review Findings: [Project Name] — [Date]

## Summary
- Total checks: N
- PASS: N
- FAIL: N
- Verdict: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL

## FAIL Items (must fix before proceeding)

### FAIL 1: [Check ID] — [Title]
- **What**: [what was found]
- **Evidence**: [specific file:line or quote]
- **Severity**: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR
- **Fix guidance**: [what needs to change]

### FAIL 2: ...

## PASS Items (notable)
- [Check ID] — note anything interesting about the pass

## Warnings (not checklist items but worth noting)
- [anything unusual observed during review]

## Reviewer Declaration
- Session was independent: [yes/no with evidence]
- Checklist was fixed (no custom additions): [yes/no]
- No files were modified during review: [yes/no]
```

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Project cannot ship. Core protocol violated. | Blocking. Fix before any further work. |
| **MAJOR** | Significant gap. Quality or correctness at risk. | Must fix before DISTRIBUTE. Can continue work phase. |
| **MINOR** | Documentation gap or style issue. | Fix before DISTRIBUTE. Low effort, high signal. |

## Feedback Loop: Findings → EXECUTOR

After the review produces findings:

1. **File the findings** — Save as `review-<date>-<project>.md` in `.omo/reviews/`
2. **Create fix tickets** — Each FAIL with CRITICAL/MAJOR severity becomes a task
3. **Execute fixes** — Use EXECUTOR.md to dispatch fix tasks. The builder AI (NOT the reviewer) makes the changes.
4. **Re-review** — After fixes are applied, run a targeted re-review on only the FAIL items
5. **Phase exit** — Only when all CRITICAL and MAJOR items are resolved does the phase exit

## Self-Review: Can the Protocol Review Itself?

This is the Gödel move. To verify the review protocol works:

1. **Run review on REVIEW.md itself**: Does this document meet its own standards? Are all checks verifiable? Is the independence protocol clear?
2. **Test the independence claim**: Run a review in a session that has context, then run one that doesn't. Do the results differ? If yes, context bias exists.
3. **Calibrate the checklist**: After 3 reviews, remove checks that always pass. Add checks that caught real issues. Keep the checklist lean — a checklist nobody runs is worse than no checklist.

Run this self-review every 5 project reviews, or after any protocol change.

## Quick Start

When you want to review a project:

> "Start a new AI session. Load only the Development-Protocol files + the project being reviewed. Run REVIEW.md checklist. Produce a findings document. Do NOT modify any files."

That's it. The protocol does the rest.
